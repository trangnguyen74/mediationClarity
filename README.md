# tnMediation

This is a package under development. Apologies for the unoriginal package name. There already exist a lot of packages for causal mediation analysis. This package implements the weighting schemes and estimators listed in a paper on simple and more robust estimation strategies (arXiv:2102.06048), which is also in evolvement.
